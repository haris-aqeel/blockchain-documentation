Solidity is an object-oriented programming language created specifically by the Ethereum Network team for constructing and designing smart contracts on Blockchain platforms.

- It's used to create smart contracts that implement business logic and generate a chain of transaction     records in the blockchain system.
- It acts as a tool for creating machine-level code and compiling it on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- It has a lot of similarities with C and C++ and is pretty simple to learn and understand. For example, a “main” in C is equivalent to a “contract” in Solidity.

Like other programming languages, Solidity programming also has variables, functions, classes, arithmetic operations, string manipulation, and many other concepts.
