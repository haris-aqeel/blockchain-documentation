A system in which a record of transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network.
Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.          

# Key elements of a blockchain
- Distributed ledger technology
- Immutable records
- Smart contracts

# How blockchain works
- As each transaction occurs, it is recorded as a “block” of data.
- Each block is connected to the ones before and after it.
- Transactions are blocked together in an irreversible chain.

# Benefits of blockchain
- Greater trust
- Greater security
- More efficiencies


# Types of blockchain networks
There are several ways to build a blockchain network. They can be public, private, permissioned or built by a consortium.

### a. Public blockchain networks
A public blockchain is one that anyone can join and participate in, such as Bitcoin.
### b. Private blockchain networks
A private blockchain network, similar to a public blockchain network, is a decentralized peer-to-peer network. However, one organization governs the network, controlling who is allowed to participate, execute a consensus protocol and maintain the shared ledger.
